##Objectives

To demonstrate an understanding of **Test Driven Development** (TDD), **Object-Oriented Programming** (OOP) and **Object-Oriented Design** (OOD).

The aim was to create a simple system for managing Boris Bikes in London. The following classes were used, Bike, User, DockingStation, Van and Garage. I used a BikeContainer module in order to extract the common functionality.
